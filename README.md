# u21-football-dashboard
Analysis of U-21 football players in European First Division

This is a data visualization project developed using Python, Tableau Public, and Figma. It explores the market value and characteristics of the most valuable football players under 21 (U-21) in 2025, based on data from Transfermarkt.

Project Overview

This project is part of my data portfolio and was carried out in three main phases:

1. Data Processing with Python
	•	I cleaned and transformed raw player data extracted from Transfermarkt.
	•	Irrelevant rows were removed, columns were renamed, and additional metrics were calculated, such as:
	•	Age
	•	Total minutes played
	•	Market value in euros
	•	I applied a filter to select only U-21 players (including those who have already turned 21).
	•	Aggregations were created to analyze data per club and league.

2. Interactive Dashboard with Tableau
	•	I built an interactive dashboard to visualize:
	•	Average and total market value, minutes played, and age of U-21 players by club, nationality, and by position
	•	Total minutes played by young players
	•	Historical market value growth of top talents 
	•	I focused on clarity and structure, aiming for accessible insights.

3. Visual Summary
	•	I created an infographic summarizing key findings.
	•	It features the Ultimate U-21 XI, including:
	•	Player names, ages, nationalities, clubs, and individual market values
	•	An ideal U-21 squad according to the players market value and minutes played
